  <h1 align="center">Moxie Protocol</h1>
</div>

Moxie is a community-owned and community-governed Farcaster protocol. Our mission is to grow the Farcaster GDP.

The core protocol team, from [Airstack](https://github.com/Airstack-xyz), have been building on Farcaster for nearly two years. We believe that Farcaster provides a fantastic tableau for next generation social networks.

However, there is one uniquely onchain ingredient missing from Farcaster that Moxie aims to fill: Economic Incentives at the protocol level. 

Quite simply, Moxie enables efficient onchain economies to be woven throughout Farcaster -- into every cast, frame, action, dc, client, app, promotion, and more.

To learn more about Moxie protocol, check out our official üìÑ whitepaper [here](https://build.moxie.xyz/).
